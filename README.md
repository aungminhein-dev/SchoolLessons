This Repository has been created to help me in my studies. As well as to improve my programming skill and to recall 
my school lessons as the same time. Since I do not get very much free time, I can't manage styling. So you guys 
please bear on it.I would like to add more complex algorithms like changing all units to SI Unit so that it would 
be really usable for every students, taking all variables and automatically detect the target values. In very soon,
I'll be working on it. 

Thank you guys!
